<p>
  I graduated from Metropolitan State University where I majored in
  Computer Information Technology. While in school, I was recognized
  for my leadership and involved in many activities, including holding
  executive board positions for three clubs, serving as Director of IT
  in Student Senate, and served on multiple committees.
</p>

<p>
  My studies have primarily focused on Java web development, but I also
  found an interest in studying Agile development methodologies,
  computer security, operating systems, and database management. After
  graduating, I held a position as a teaching assistant for the JROTC
  Cyber Academy course hosted by my university, which is a six week
  course lead by industry professionals that provides the opportunity
  for high school students to earn college credit and receive CompTIA
  IT Fundamentals certification.

  I have completed training through Dev10 as a certified 
  <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/0f43eec8-98fe-4962-bac3-0bf58f6830c6">Java Full Stack Developer</a> 
  where I demonstrated my web development skills by completing weekly
  mastery assessments, demonstrating object-oriented programming 
  techniques, and participating in a two week group capstone project 
  using Spring Boot and React.
