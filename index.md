## School Projects

For my Computer Security course, I wrote a set of [blog posts](https://oneexists.github.io/blog/all) to share articles related to computer security. 

I took a course on software development that focused on learning Agile Development Methodologies. In this course, I helped build a Game Recommendation Manager (GRM) Project, which allows users to take a quiz that will provide recommended games based on ratings retrieved from SteamSpy and the user's personal gaming profile. 

For this project, I contributed with providing the login, create new user, edit user, and menu functionality over the course of the three elaborations.
I have created a page for the [Login Use Case Artifacts](https://oneexists.github.io/html/GRM_Login_Use_Case.html) from this project.

## Personal Project

At the beginning of 2020, upon my decision to continue on with persuing my bachelor's degree, I started a personal project to digitize records from the bullet journal I'd been keeping. In this journal, I'd been keeping track of books I read, albums I listened to, TV shows and movies I watched, along with various other planning and tracking activities. My goal was to start building an application that would keep track of some of these things for me so I would have a personal database of things I tracked long term. I knew this project would be a bigger undertaking, so I set out with the intention to evolve it as I explored learning outside of the classroom. As a result, it has been rewritten in pieces to fit learning about Python, database design, Java, design pattern practice, and most recently to start learning Spring Boot. Pieces of this project have been shared in the repositories [bujo](https://github.com/oneexists/bujo) and [trackers](https://github.com/oneexists/trackers).
