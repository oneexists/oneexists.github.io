## School Projects

For my Computer Security course, I wrote a set of [blog posts](https://oneexists.github.io/blog/all) to share articles related to computer security. 

I took a course on software development that focused on learning Agile Development Methodologies. In this course, I helped build a Game Recommendation Manager (GRM) Project, which allows users to take a quiz that will provide recommended games based on ratings retrieved from SteamSpy and the user's personal gaming profile. 

For this project, I contributed with providing the login, create new user, edit user, and menu functionality over the course of the three elaborations.
I have created a page for the [Login Use Case Artifacts](https://oneexists.github.io/html/GRM_Login_Use_Case.html) from this project.
