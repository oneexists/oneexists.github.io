## Introduction to Security on Linux Systems

One of the selling points on switching to Linux is the reuptation it has for being a secure system. Unfortunately, the entry level for understanding comparison points for how secure it is takes a better understanding of what constitutes as a "more secure" system and what it is about Linux that provides greater security. Linux offers a system with fewer exploits for vulnerabilities in the operating system, but there are important steps to setting up security that differs from the experiences with Windows systems that many are familiar with on their PC. 

Linux systems do not require the typical antivirus software that is often packaged with Windows distributions. With an initial setup of the two operating systems, Linux has the edge of providing better security, but there are a few practices that increase the security of the system to offer better protection.

The easiest way to start maintain a more secure Linux machine is to install updates regularly. Some distributions offer an Update Manager to give an alternative to the traditional terminal commands. One way to ensure files are protected on your machine is to double check that the home partition of the system is encrypted and that file permissions are set to limit access to only those users who need access to them. This helps espeically for systems with multiple users who want to ensure isolation between their files.
