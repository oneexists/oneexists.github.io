# First, let's talk about DevOps

An initial DevOps definition was provided by Penners and Dyck
to be: "a mindset, encouraging cross-functional collaboration between
teams -- especially development and IT operations -- within a software
development organization, in order to operate resilient systems
and accelerate delivery of changes". This definition provides some
insight into what DevOps is, but it often leaves something to be
desired as even the authors acknowledged its need to be expanded upon
with the input of practitioners to provide insights into a more precise
definition.

Through study of primary and secondary data including semi-structured
interviews and literature such as blogs, trade journals, articles, and
various other online writings, a more clear definition can be reached.
With writing of Lwakatare, Kuvaja, and Oivo in "An Exploratory Study of
DevOps Extending the Dimensions of DevOps with Practices", the authors
were able to define a set of goals aligned with DevOps practices and
identify some of the practices themselves. These goals included reduced
response time, reliable and high quality software, and unified workflows
through transparency and collaboration. These goals can also be expanded
to include advanced automation and the evolution of traditional roles.

The aim of these practices is to support fast-paced changes as software
is developed and delivered, break down organizational silos to help
encourage collaboration, and to provide the advantages of a supportive
working environment for teams.

# What about Agile Development?

These goals in DevOps may sound familiar to those who are familiar with
Agile Development methodologies. Some of the driving forces behind these
methodologies are to quickly respond to changes, build workflows to be
responsive to uncertainty, and allow teams to provide cross-functional
support. Many Agile Development practices focus on collaboration and
organization of work.

Agile Development is often referred to as a mindset with its values
and principles defined in its Agile Manifesto. Often a team's culture
will be built around a shared understanding of practices or conventions
that everyone agrees to follow. There are various frameworks and
possible applications of Agile Development including Scrum and XP that
guide teams towards an Agile culture that can be customized to fit a
specific team's needs. These practices are even being applied generally
to project management as a means of providing a general guideline for
creating a team environment that is adaptable and built to continuously
provide progress towards the goals of the project.

# Bringing it all together

The cultures between DevOps practices and Agile Development can align
in a way to build effective, responsive teams. With some attention to
the specific needs of the projects and team members, some foundational
steps can be taken to build a culture that can consistently provide
high quality software, fast deployment and a coordinated effort.

### Creating effective meetings

One focus of both Agile Development and DevOps practices is the regular
team meetings. Some possible practices to implement would be to
establish a regular space for team meetings. This can be either physical
or virtual, but the important part is the setting, which includes
creating a standard time and place where these meetings will happen.

DevOps emphasizes the breaking down of silos when creating these meeting
settings, so it would be wise to ensure that any team that may interact
together is hosting these meetings in a way that members can easily
attend cross-team meetings as needed. Not only does this allow the team
member to be involved in both their own and another team's meeting, but
also allows the team member to open communication between the teams by
reporting back any relevant details as needed in a timely manner.

Agile Development focuses on ensuring that the team is meeting regularly,
often daily as is the case with stand-ups, where each member is sharing
their contributions, obstacles, and intentions going forward. This slim
agenda that is often used for these daily meetings also enforces creating
a consistent setting for the teams to communicate and increase their
collaboration.

This focus on creating a consistent and open setting for meetings aligns
with the goals of transparent workflows, reduced response time, and
ultimately results in higher quality development. The culture created
through the cooperation of these teams can extend to the broader needs
of the project and encourage others to reflect on how their workflow
can be adapted to encourage effective communication, team organization
and higher quality work.

### Iterative and incremental development

One of the focuses of Agile Development is to provide a regular pace
of development with the strategy of moving from one step to the next
with regular smaller contributions. Over time, this will build out
a project while providing consistent additions of usable functionality.
This regularity provides a repetitive nature to the workflow of
various activities and allows for reflection on previously implemented
work as it is built upon. This promotes the continual improvement of
the project as it is enhanced and revised intentionally.

It can be difficult to coordinate this kind of improvement without
the involvement of the whole team. Revising work can cause unpredictable
results if those revising it are only privy to a smaller understanding
of the broader project being built. This is where the integration of
the DevOps practice of collaboration can provide added benefits to the
Agile Development methodology. Teams are encouraged to learn "beyond"
the work they are directly contributing to by attending cross-team
meetings and by being directly involved in each others' work. Adding this
increased involvement and responsibilities allows for higher confidence
when contributing to the revision and enhancement of the project.

While it may be easier to notice a team member that is less involved
in contributing to the addition of new functionality, it may not be
as obvious if the team is tending to neglect revision of previous work.
This may not seem like an urgent issue, but increased attention to
revision can result in continually increasing the quality of work,
both previous and future, by allowing for greater reflection to how
the functionality can be improved.

Another important aspect of improving the overall functionality and
quality of work is encouraging the early involvement of operations in
understanding the requirements, along with involving the development
team in utilizing tools to implement infrastructure-as-code. This can
result in a better coordinated effort in effectively meeting
requirements and greater consistency between production and development
environments.

### Retrospective

As was briefly mentioned, one important aspect of improving the quality
of work is to intentionally provide opportunity for reflection. While
the focus between Agile and DevOps may appear different in this regard,
both implement practices that emphasize the importance of proactively
reviewing what was done and how to use that knowledge to improve in
the future.

Some of the practices suggested by DevOps include monitoring and
utilization of metrics. Through the creation of a workflow of data
monitoring, a set of insights can be gleaned and communicated to
the team through feedback. Monitoring can be done to support both
development and operations teams as they determine the parameters
and how their data is important to the understanding of the work
being done.

The collection of metrics can provide insights into what is
ultimately important about the work being completed. These metrics
often focus on business value and can provide incentive as teams
are able to see "tangible" results. This gives a high-level insight
into what impact the team is making over time. It also helps to
drive the team in making changes to the system, improvements, and
important decisions that may have been otherwise difficult to
conceptualize or identify. Progress can be seen more easily and
the team can use the opportunity to review any possible areas for
future revision as they gain insights into the overall picture and
see the results of their collective work.

While teams may choose to reflect on a more regular basis at a
smaller level, Agile Development encourages specific time to be set
aside with a focus on a broader retrospective. As time passes and
milestones are reached, it can be beneficial to implement the
metrics, monitoring, and any other relevant reviews into a broader
analysis of significant aspects of the project. This is another
opportunity to break down the barriers between teams and gather
together to learn about what has been accomplished and how that
progress contributes to the broader perspective of the development
of the project.

# Reflections on building a new team culture

While these two topics are often presented separately, their practices
can be integrated across teams in a way that encourages mindfulness
surrounding how a team works together to effectively produce continual
progress on a project. With the establishment of some of these practices
a team can learn how to better understand the specific work they are
involved in, along with a broader knowledge of the activities happening
around them.

It may not be obvious at first, but an important lesson in how to build
an effective team can be learned. Both Agile Development and DevOps
practices are the results of reflecting on how previous practices have
failed to effectively navigate a team through changing requirements and
the growing scope of development. They also encourage a level of
customization and selective adoption of practices to suit the specific
needs of the teams involved. It may seem intimidating to some to start
changing division of responsibilities, how teams are structured, and
how workflows are managed, but these changes can be made selectively
in a way that supports specific needs.

These ideas were built through reflection of previous methodologies
and intentional revisiting of practices to develop a better way of
doing things. If the bigger ideas presented seem to be more than
what a team is willing to implement, then it may be time to review
the current practices and consider what small changes can be made to
provide the biggest impact in increasing the effectiveness of current
practices. This key idea of reviewing and improving the work being done
will provide a path towards integrating practices needed to more
effectively achieve the goals set out for the project.
