A quick practice to start increasing security on a mobile device is to become selective in choosing apps to download. This helps protect the device from possible malicious applications, but also limits the number of places your personal data may be collected and stored, which functions to decrease overall risk.

It is easy to follow this practice with regularly reviewing applications that are downloaded and removing the ones that aren't being used anymore. These applications can often have access to various permissions on the device, which leaves the device open to be accessed in a way that could personal information.

The next step in quickly increasing device security is to review the public WiFi connections allowed. This is especially important for those who connect to these networks without a VPN to provide encryption. Others who are connected to the network could gain access to sensitive information if it isn't encrypted.
