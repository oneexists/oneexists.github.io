    <h3>Gender Inclusive Pronoun Awareness</h3>
    <p>The PRIDE Club (People Representing Inclusion, Diversity, and Excellence)
      is a student club at Century College that allows students to get involved
      with advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community, along with providing a space for
      students to meet each other. Involvement in this group allowed me to
      participate in volunteer work for local organizations and attend conferences
      across the Midwest. I was president of the club for two years and in that time
      I was able to advocate for greater bathroom access on campus, create community
      events to bring many clubs across campus together, and break down barriers
      for students changing their name on campus by aiding in simplifying the
      process.</p>
