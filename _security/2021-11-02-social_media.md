title: "Inherent Trust in Social Media"

Social media has shifted to become more and more present in daily life. While there are
those out there who have rejected its use, either from the outset or as a decision
after realizing it isn't the best way to be spending the day, there are still many
who rely on various platforms. As it has become harder to escape, there
are many ways social media continues to falsely presents itself as neutral or trustworthy.

One of the shifts that can happen with the use of social media is reflected in its
focus only on creating weak ties rather than supporting strong friendships. Interactions
are often fleeting and the uniform experience from interacting with one person to
another creates a false equivalency between various friendships and relationships
with others. These platforms often also rely on creating a large user base to support
itself as a business, which creates its own challenges in how to manage such great
size of varying interactions.

These structures that social media is built on create opportunities for various
types of security issues, whether that be from passing around "quizzes" that can be
used to target individuals in a social engineering attack where they are publicly
posting personal information, such as indications of their birthday, names, places,
or events that could be used for security questions or passwords. It is also in the
size of these social media platforms where it becomes easier to exploit inherent bias
or even foster trust among individuals by exploiting the weak social ties created
through interactions online and the uniform appearance in how everything is presented.

One proposed suggestion to combat some of the issues that can appear in social media
is to look at the various ways constraints can be applied. This is normally done
on various platforms through limiting video length, post length, number of posts in
a day, or persistence of the post. This kind of change could be used in a way to
minimize potential for exploitative actions, such as Google+ focusing on creating
many smaller groups of people rather than focusing on the singular friend list
that has become almost a standard. This shift in focusing on smaller groups of people
more closely follows the social interactions and patterns that are already present
in social circles.

It is irresponsible for these large platforms to insist on their size being a
necessary aspect of business without equally developing and researching the effects
of how these tools can be used to exploit users and feed off of inherent bias it
fosters. Ian Bogost published an article in The Atlantic with more insight into
how social media can become a distortion of social interaction titled ["People
Aren't Meant to Talk This Much"](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/fix-facebook-making-it-more-like-google/620456/)
that details the ways in which social media becomes socially irresponsible.
