## STIR/SHAKEN, Spoofing, and SMS

Telemarketing is nothing new, but the methods used by scammers have evolved from year
to year with the technology available. The F.C.C. has taken action in the form of STIR/SHAKEN,
which limits the ability for robocallers to use phony caller IDs. This is a practice
used by many scammers that is referred to as "spoofing" that can be effective in
convincing someone to answer the call since it is easier to believe it is a genuine call
coming from a local number. It is also tempting to answer these calls as attempt
to stop them by expressing disapproval in any number of ways, but this can unfortunately
lead to receiving even more unwanted calls.

A newer form of spam that has been of concern is the increase in spam texts. At this
point, there is some awareness about not answering robocalls, or in the least just
hanging up the phone once the recording starts, but spam texts can be deceptive in
their simplicity. They may seem like they are less risky to interact with than a
phone call, but some can have more malicious intent than they appear. It is tempting
again to respond, especially if they are sent to a group and others are engaging
by responding to the group. It is best to delete these messages without even opening
them to minimize risks of being targeted further or becoming victim to any possible
attack it may contain.

As more and more of our lives are managed on cell phones, it is important to be
practicing caution and hesitancy just as is recommended when clicking on links elsewhere,
such as email and websites. Gail Collins provides some context around the current
environment with robocalls and the need for the F.C.C. to recognize these concerns
as a higher priority in the article,
