## Security Concerns with IoT Devices

With the increasing availability of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, it is important
to be aware of how to enable better security practices considering the increased
risk of using these devices throughout our environment.

The quickest way to start implementing better practices with these devices is to
take the time to look through the settings options. Taking the time to better understand
the settings of how the device works while deciding which settings are best for its use
can minimize security risk. Ensuring these devices are set up to update automatically
through thier settings provides a quick way of minimizing vulnerabilities when using
the device.

The next level of providing security in depth would be evaluating the network
settings. This could be creating two separate networks to isolate devices or
even something as simple as ensuring the password set on the network connection
is following recommendations.

A great resource for creating a secure environment for Internet of Things devices
is put out by CISA in ["Securing the Internet of Things"](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST17-001).
