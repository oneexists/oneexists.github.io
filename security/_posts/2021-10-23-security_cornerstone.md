## Security as the Cornerstone

Linux's core structure is built with security in mind by giving users lower access rights and creating strong separation between users. A password and user ID are required for each user, and this combination with the user's lower access rights creates regular opportunities for user authentication before privileges are elevated. A quick practice to start when using the Linux terminal is to favor the "sudo" command over "su". This ensures that every time higher access rights are needed, authentication will take place.

Another feature of Linux systems that increases security is the open source format and variety of flavors. The source code is [easily available](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), allowing for a wide community of contributors to find and fix any vulnerabilities. The wide variety of Linux distributions and seemingly endless customization options creates difficulties in finding a vulnerability that can be widely exploited across distributions.

As with the shift with Apple computers from being able to be protected by their previous scarcity, Linux has started to see a shift as it becomes more popular and malware has started to appear. There is a bit of a learning curve to understand some of the structure and utility of Linux, but with the increasing importance in security as operating systems become less and less separated from the broader Internet and cloud services, taking time to learn about operating systems is a valuable investment.
